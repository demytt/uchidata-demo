# Welcome on Uchidata SDK for python developpers #

This README will explain you how to send request to Uchidata API.

Every request must have the following structure :

```json
{
  "key":"your_api_key"
  "model":"model_to_request"
  "observations" = [{"id":1, "content":"XXX"}, {"id":2, "content":"YYY"}, {"id":3, "content":"ZZZ"}]
}
```

Where :
  - key = your API key. If you don't have access to the demo, feel free to ask on [our website](http://uchidata.com) 
  - model = the model to request. Accepted values : "sentiment", "review", "topic", "product-classification"
  - maximum number of observations per request : 10

Please send the request to the url specified when you ask for a free access on [uchidata.com](http://uchidata.com)
